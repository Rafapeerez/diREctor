### DESCRIPTION

This repository contains my TFG code. A mobile application made with Flutter for the management of musical groups. This idea went up from a conversation with the musical director of "Nuestro Padre Jes√∫s de la Redenci√≥n de C√≥rdoba", to improve its management.

### How to start?

It is necessary to install the following tools:

- Git: To have the code versions controlled.
- VsCode: Install the following recommended extensions: Dart, Flutter, ErrorLens.  
- Android Studio: Although as a text editor we are going to use VsCode, it is necessary to launch android emulators.
- Flutter Sdk: To use Flutter and compile Dart.

These tools are for Android programmers. There are more necessary tools for IOS people (like xCode).

#### First step

I'm going to suppose you have configure at least one emulator in Android Studio. If I suppose bad then here you have a [tutorial:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBTNUpp72ik).
It is possible use your physical device to test the app. You have to activate the developper function in your phone and USB debugging. Doing this and being connected phyiscally to the computer, your device should appear.

Follow the next steps:

Using the VSCode palette (CTRL+SHIFT+P) you search:
### `Flutter: Select Device`
You decide the device to launch the app.

### `Flutter: Launch Device`

To test the app do the next command and and wait for it to finish loading and the app to appear in the device:
### `F5`
Start debugging the code, it is important to do the command in the main.dart file.
